utilisateurs de suivre, gérer et optimiser leurs abonnements de manière automatique et intuitive. En intégrant des API de services populaires, l'application récupère les informations des abonnements en temps réel, éliminant la saisie manuelle. \nElle offre des notifications pour rappeler les dates de renouvellement et les conditions d'annulation spécifiques, permettant ainsi aux utilisateurs d'éviter des frais indésirables. Grâce à un tableau de bord clair, les utilisateurs peuvent visualiser leurs dépenses mensuelles et annuelles, et une fonctionnalité d'analyse des emails permet d'importer facilement les abonnements. \nEn résumé, l'application aide les utilisateurs à gérer leurs abonnements de façon efficace et à prendre des décisions éclairées pour optimiser leurs
